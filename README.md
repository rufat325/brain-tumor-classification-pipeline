# brain-tumor-classification-pipeline
## Project Description
This deep learning pipeline was created to classify MRI images of brain tumors to assist in early diagnosis. The dataset contains over **7,000 images** of different types of brain tumors. The pipeline processes and augments the images, followed by training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify the tumors.

The project includes:
1. **Data preprocessing**: Image resizing and augmentation for improved generalization.
2. **Model training**: Using CNN to classify the brain MRI images.
3. **Evaluation**: The model achieved a test accuracy of **94.1%**, making it highly suitable for real-world medical applications.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Medical Image Processing**: MRI scans
